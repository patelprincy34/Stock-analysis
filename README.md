## Summary

- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
*The advantages of refactoring code include the ability to evaluate the dataset with just minimal modifications, the ability to readily find errors, and the ability to rapidly identify where the code has to be modified.

*The disadvantages of refactoring our code are that it is easy to duplicate it, it takes time to understand and change the code if the steps are not identified, and testing results can be affected, resulting in extra time spent rectifying the code, making the process inefficient and time consuming.


- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script? 
*Refactoring helps us to conduct data analysis more quickly, especially if we need to retrieve the dataset again later. Making changes and comprehending the code steps will be more difficult if the code we're reworking isn't clear and concise, therefore it's critical to specify comprehensive procedures and have a clear picture of what we're trying to evaluate.
